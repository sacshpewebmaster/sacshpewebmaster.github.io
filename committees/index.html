    			<p>The academic committee is a place where you will find the necessary resources to be successful. We will discuss many study techniques and ways to be more productive and efficient. As apart of the committee you will learn how to be a good student and will be encouraged to help your fellow SHPE members. You will be instrumental in the success of your SHPE chapter and your academic career. I will do my best to provide the help you need and will listen to any ideas you may have. We will look for sholarships, help bring a panel for our graduate workshop, and help organise an academic competition among other great events and opportunities. Join your SHPE academic committee and inspire others, motivate your peers and thrive as a student and become a professional. </p>

    		<h3>Fundraising | <small>Thursdays @ 4:30p, Location: TBD | <a href="../officers/#fundraising">Director of Fundraising</a></small></h3>
    			<p>Fundraising is about getting as much funds as we can to sustain our chapter. Therefore, the job of this committee is to come up with fundraising strategies and organize fundraising events. My plan for the following semester is to host a couple of fundraisers as well as other activities that will get us some money. In my committee you will have the opportunity to develop leadership and communication skills. My goal is to give members what they need to grow professionally.
    			<br>
    			We will be in charge of planning, organizing, and advertising fundraising events. So if you feel like you want to be part of this, please join my committee. And if you have other ideas on how to raise money please share those with me. I’d love to hear them.</p>

    		<h3>Futures | <small>Fridays @ 4p - 5p, Location: TBD | <a href="../officers/#vp">Vice President</a></small></h3>
    			<p>The Futures Committee was developed in 2016 and has since helped incoming college freshmen establish time management and communication skills and professionalism. Incoming freshmen have learned to step out of their comfort zone, meet new people from various backgrounds, show off their creativity and ultimately helps them develop a better understanding of what it takes to be an involved and academically successful college student. 
                <br />
                The Futures committee hosts their very own events twice every year. So if you are looking for a way to showcase your creativity and develop yourself as a STEM leader, join the Futures Committee.</p>

    		<h3>Outreach | <small>Thursdays @ 6:00p, Location: TBD | <a href="../officers/#outreach">Director of Outreach</a></small></h3>
    			<p>Welcome to Outreach! The goal of Outreach is to spread the knowledge of the STEM field to the youth of Sacramento. I oversee Thriving Youth Program and Noche de Ciencas. Within the Thriving Youth program, we hold the monthly STEM Nights. During the STEM Night’s we do mini science projects with the after-school program there. Noche de Ciencas is similar to the STEM Nights but it is an event held in an elementary school and bigger than the STEM Nights. Both events are focused to inform the Sacramento youth the STEM is not a scary field to be involved in. What my committee does is they help me plan these two events. We come up with the projects to Noche de Ciencas and help organize the day. You are always welcome to pitch ideas and events pertaining to STEM that we can be involved in. I also will try to inform you on any community service event that is around Sac State involving STEM, so that you can get those community service hours done as soon as possible. If you like getting involved in the community and helping the youth in spreading the cheer of STEM come join my Outreach Committee.</p>

    		<h3>Professional Development | <small>Times TBD, Location: TBD | <a href="../officers/#professionaldevelopment">Director of Professional Development</a></small></h3>
    			<p>Naturally as an engineering student people ask the question “do you have a life?” and say “all I do is see you guys study!”. Although this may be slightly true it is not wrong to say that we also do have outside lives separate from our studies. When I’m not busy studying or working I enjoy activities such as running, paintballing, snowboarding, and even flying planes! I once had a dream of becoming a pilot; a soon to be reality. I once had  a dream of completing a 100 mile endurance run; something that I have accomplished and intend to accomplish again. I once had a dream that I would be able to complete college with an engineering degree; here I am as a first year college student and junior mechanical engineering in the making. Although I may seem to do these things for myself, I really hope to accomplish major goals, aim for the skies, and run that extra mile in order to inspire anyone who I get the chance to meet!  Feel free to say hi or just ask a question any time whenever I’m around and I look forward to being your Director for Professional Development for  the year of 2017!</p>
